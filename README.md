## arborelia's Archipelago branch for Traverse Town Arcade

Archipelago worlds are developed by forking the entire Archipelago repository, even when you're usually working on just a single world that will be loaded as an .apworld file.

This is my fork where I'm maintaining the version of Ittle Dew 2 randomizer that we play in Flannel Patch and Traverse Town Arcade.
